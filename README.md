# MazeDrone Project with TF-Agents

![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project_Status:-Ongoing_(06/Jun/2024)-orange)

Evolution of my old personal project [MazeDrone](https://github.com/AndreNasci/MazeDrone). It involves the development and training of a neural network, using TensorFlow Agents, capable of controlling a drone (or any moving robot) through a maze.

## Credits
This project uses a modified version of the maze generator [pymaze](https://github.com/jostbr/pymaze), by jostbr.
